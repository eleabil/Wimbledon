  <h2 class="h2">US Open Day 10: Djokovic advances as Japan doubles up in last four</h2><hr class="news-hr">
  <p>Novak Djokovic did what Roger Federer couldn’t do at the US Open, Japan moved closer to having a first ever Grand Slam singles champion and Madison Keys took a step nearer to going one better than last year on another dramatic day at Flushing Meadows.</p>
  <h5 class="h5">Djokovic ends Millman’s run</h5>
  <p>It took perhaps the form player in the men's draw, Novak Djokovic, to end the dream run of John Millman, an Australian who was ranked 55 at the start of the US Open, but had caused an enormous shock when he beat Roger Federer in the previous round.</p>
  <p>Yet Millman found the Serb in no mood to follow suit.</p>
  <p>He didn’t give in easily, though, and the 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 scoreline was perhaps a little flattering to Djokovic, who again had to work hard in incredibly humid conditions at Flushing Meadows before taking his place in the semi-finals.</p>
  <img src="pictures/news/djokovic.jpg" alt="Novak Djokovic" class="img-fluid mx-auto">
  <p>The Serb needed to take some tablets during the second set as he again struggled in the conditions, and he was frustrated by Millman’s resistance, missing 16 of 20 break points.</p><p>
  When Millman broke back from 3-1 down in the third set, it seemed like it might go into a fourth set but Djokovic recovered his poise and finished off in style.</p>
  <p>"I personally have never sweated as much as I have here,” Djokovic said. “Incredible. I have to take at least 10 shirts for every match. It's literally two games (in) and you're soaking," said Djokovic, who will play Kei Nishikori in the semis.</p><hr class="news-hr">
  <h5 class="h5">Nishikori gains revenge on Cilic</h5>
  <p>  It might have taken four years but Kei Nishikori finally got a small measure of revenge over Marin Cilic for his defeat by the Croat in the 2014 US Open final.</p>
  <p>Outplayed in the first set by a dominant Cilic, Nishikori made a few minor adjustments, in particular to his return position, and it worked, eventually getting over the line with a 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4 victory.</p>
  <p>No Japanese man or woman has ever won a Grand Slam singles title but Nishikori is two wins away from making history. “I started playing better from 4-2 in the first set,” he said.</p>
  <p>“I tried to swing little more and play aggressive and it started working better. I am really happy to win, go through matches like this. It wasn't easy and I didn't feel like I was playing best tennis today, but I fought through somehow and it gives me big confidence playing semis.”</p><hr class="news-hr">
  <h5 class="h5">Keys and Osaka set up semi-final</h5>
  <p>The women’s semi-final line-up was completed, with last year’s runner-up Madison Keys and Japan’s Naomi Osaka booking a last-four clash in emphatic fashion.</p>
  <p>American Keys was a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Carla Suarez Navarro, the No.30 seed from Spain, while Osaka crushed Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine 6-1, 6-1.</p>
  Keys has dropped just one set on her way through to the semi-finals and having played late into the night on several occasions last year, she has enjoyed a smoother run to this stage.
  <p>“I feel like last year a lot of my matches were kind of emotional roller coasters, and this year I feel like I have been much more solid mentally, and in tougher times keeping my cool a little bit better and not having to have the big emotional swing to kind of try to get back into matches," she said. Osaka, who moved to the US when she was three years old, thanked Nishikori for the growing interest in her game in Japan and said she had got to know him a bit more in recent times. “I just think he's…a really big kid,” Osaka said. “I don't know how to describe it. He plays games and stuff, too. I think we're pretty similar in that sense. Overall, he's just really nice and positive and bubbly and stuff.” Nishikori laughed at the response. “Well, she looks matured and she looks older, but when we talk, she's also a kid,” Nishikori said. 
  <p>Osaka’s win, combined with Nishikori's means Japan have two players in the last four of a Grand Slam for the first time and Osaka is the first Japanese woman to make the semi-finals of a Grand Slam since Kimiko Date Krumm at Wimbledon in 1996.</p><hr class="news-hr">
